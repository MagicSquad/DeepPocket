# DeepPocket
Hi Ravi!
This is a read me file.
"Deep pocket" is the name I chose for our repository(storage area).You can store data/files in it.
Our repository has 3 branches at the moment- 
    1."master" branch : will contain the main copy of all our documents.
    2."secretary" branch :(name I chose) will contain duplicates for modifications. Try making changes in the present files, commiting them, and submitting them for review (submit pull request).
    3."readme-change" : same as 2.
                                                                                      -Vishal
                                                                                      
                                                                                       wtf!!
